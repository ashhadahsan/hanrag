## üöß Implementation Gaps & Future Work

This implementation covers the core HANRAG concepts but has several gaps compared to the original paper. Here's what we **did not implement** and what could be added in future versions:

### ‚ùå Missing Components

  - 9,741 straightforward queries from CommonSenseQA
  - 50,000 single-step queries from Natural Questions + MuSiQue
  - 50,000 complex queries from MuSiQue training data
  - 50,000 compound queries with custom construction
- **Our Implementation**: Uses generic prompts without specialized training data

2. **Data Pipeline**: Need automated training data construction
3. **Evaluation Framework**: Need comprehensive benchmark integration
4. **Model Management**: Need proper model versioning and configuration

### Evaluation Framework

Our evaluation framework extends the paper's benchmarks with:

- RAGAS-inspired metrics (Faithfulness, Answer Relevance, Context Precision/Recall)
- Noise resistance testing
- Multi-hop reasoning accuracy measurement
- Comprehensive comparison with traditional RAG

**Note**: This implementation now fully implements the HANRAG research paper with the complete Revelator architecture, providing a production-ready system for multi-hop question answering with intelligent query routing, parallel processing, and noise resistance capabilities.
